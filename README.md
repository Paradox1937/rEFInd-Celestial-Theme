# Installation
If you found this repository, I assume you installed rEFInd Boot Manager and realized, that it
looks like shit. Themes like mine are here to fix that!
If you didnt already install rEFInd, go to https://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/installing.html
and follow the instructions.  

So, if you installed rEFInd, I assume you use at least one Linux Distribution on your PC.
Im gonna do a step-by-step guide on how you can apply this Theme.  

# 1.Start your Linux Distribution
*Self explaining ig*  

# 2.Start a new Terminal
*either open it normally or press `ctrl-alt-t`*  

# 3.Open your Filemanager as root
*This can be different for some users but for most of you it's probably `sudo nautilus` confirm with typing in your password and you should have your filemanager open.*  

# 4.Navigating to rEFInds boot-directory
*on the left side, you should see a directory called `efi` If not, search it in your root-folder. open it. Inside that folder, navigate to `/EFI/refind`*  

# 5.moving the files to the directory
*If you haven't already done that, download the files from this repository or download them from the latest release. Now open another window of your filemanager and go to your downloads. you'll probably need to unpack the zip file. After doing that, you should be able to simply drag the files from your Downloads-folder to the window with the rEFInd-folder. Do that with the `celestial` folder.*  
*Now delete the `refind.conf` file from refinds directory, and replace it with the `refind.conf` file you just downloaded from this repository. Now the Theme should be installed and you should be ready to go! After restarting your PC and booting into rEFInd, you should see the Theme completely loaded. If you see a glitchy mess/it didnt load or is simply not working, contact me and I'll help you.*
